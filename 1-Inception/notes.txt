Adding react to html file using cdn links - 

add below scripts in the html file - These script will fetch the source code of react from CDN and add it in the html file which we can use in html file.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>


Once we add these in html then we will get React object in the console of the browser.

Type React in the console of the browser.

in above script tag crossorigin attribute is used to fetch the script without credentials like cookies, http auth etc.

From above scripts we will get the react source code and React dom. 

Dom - Document object model
